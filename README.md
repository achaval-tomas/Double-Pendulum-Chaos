# Double-Pendulum-Chaos
Double Pendulum Simulation showing chaos emerging from slightly different initial conditions.

Three double pendulum systems with slightly different initial conditions, evolving into chaos as I trace each pendulum's path.

You can change the initial conditions of each system or add more systems in the file **systems.py** to obtain different outcomes.

Run with ```` python3 doublePendulum.py ```` and press ````spacebar```` to start the simulation.<br />
Get pygame ```` sudo apt-get install python3-pygame ````
