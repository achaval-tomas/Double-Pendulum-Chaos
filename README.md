# Double-Pendulum-Chaos
Double Pendulum Simulation showing chaos emerging from slightly different initial conditions.

Three double pendulum systems with slightly different initial conditions, evolving into chaos as I trace each pendulum's path.

You can change the initial condition of each of the 3 systems in the code to obtain different outcomes.
